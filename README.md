# 🏎️ F1 Podium Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses historical Formula 1 data to **predict the probability of a driver finishing on the podium (top 3)** in upcoming races using a **Random Forest Classifier**.

## 📌 Project Overview

* **Objective**: Predict podium finishes (top 3) based on constructor and driver statistics.
* **ML Model**: `RandomForestClassifier` from `sklearn`
* **Target Variable**: `podium` (1 = finished in top 3, 0 = otherwise)
* **Prediction Example**: 2025 Chinese Grand Prix podium probabilities for all drivers.

## 📁 Dataset Used

All CSVs are sourced from [Formula 1 Kaggle datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets):

* `results.csv`: Race results (driver, constructor, grid, position, points)
* `races.csv`: Race metadata (raceId, year, circuitId)
* `constructors.csv`: Constructor team information
* `drivers.csv`: Driver personal information

## 🧠 Features Used

| Feature Name         | Description                                        |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `avg_grid`           | Average grid position of the constructor in a year |
| `total_points`       | Total team points in that year                     |
| `avg_position`       | Average finishing position of the constructor      |
| `driver_points`      | Total points scored by the driver in that year     |
| `past_podiums`       | Number of podiums secured by the driver            |
| `races_participated` | Races participated by the driver                   |
| `circuitId`          | Encoded track ID where race is held                |

## 🧪 Model Workflow

```text
1. Load and merge datasets
2. Feature engineering (per year driver & team stats)
3. Encode categorical variables (circuitId)
4. Train/Test split (80/20)
5. Train RandomForestClassifier
6. Evaluate: Accuracy, Classification Report, Confusion Matrix, Cross-Validation
7. Predict podium probabilities for future race (e.g., Chinese GP 2025)
```

---

## 📊 Model Performance

* **Accuracy**: \~XX.XX% *(example: 85.6%)*
* **Cross-Validation Accuracy (5-Fold)**: \~XX.XX%
* **Precision / Recall / F1**: See classification report in terminal output
* **Confusion Matrix**: True/False Positives & Negatives

## 🏁 Sample Prediction Output

Predicted podium probabilities for all drivers in 2025 Chinese Grand Prix:

```text
Constructor         | Driver              | Podium Probability
---------------------------------------------------------------
Red Bull            | Max Verstappen      | 85.67%
Ferrari             | Charles Leclerc     | 72.45%
Mercedes            | Lewis Hamilton      | 68.90%
...
```
